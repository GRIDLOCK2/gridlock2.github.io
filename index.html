    <p class="grid-6">Hello and welcome to my first website.  In the beginning of making this website I was really unsure of what I wanted to put into it, but as I have progressed through this course I have enjoyed picking and choosing design techniques that I have learned and figuring out how to manipulate them.  I know that this is only the beginning and that this website isn't too technical compared to others on the web, but I look forward to learning more and improving my skills.</p>
